# Purpose
This is 100% a creative expression of my mind, bridging front-end development with my personal interest. Eager to explore **React development** to create an editorial style website. The content is inspired by a creative brand run by two women whose names both end with Ela, not Ella. To goal was to create a clean, intentional, and magnetic website. This project is just one example of how I tackle my projects - aiming to showcase the uniqueness each brand brings and draw in the right audience. I design the layout of websites with extreme thoughfulness.

## Why It’s Here
This repo shows how I approach front-end development with a strong sense of **aesthetic design**, **creative branding**, and **component-based structure** using modern tools like React + Vite.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
