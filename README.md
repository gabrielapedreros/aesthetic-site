# 🌿 Personal Aesthetic Minimal Website

This is a creative front-end project I designed and built to explore **React development** through the lens of design, minimalism, and personal expression. Inspired by editorial layouts and Vogue-style magazine aesthetics, the goal was to create something clean, intentional, and beautiful. This is just one example of how I attack my projects - with authentic thoughfulness and a unique vision.

The project is themed around a fictional creative brand concept based on my friend and me — both of our names end in *Ela* (not Ella). We’re both naturally creative and business-minded, and this playful site represents that shared energy.

## 📌 Why It’s Here

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
