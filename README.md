# Purpose
I built this website using React with JSX and Vite due to its fast development environment. The modularity in React allowed for each section to be separated into major components that I can easily manage and build upon. This made the development process efficient, where each page had a .jsx and .css file for implementing the style and structure. I used Git to manage version control. 

Modular components

The goal was to create a sleek, intentional, and magnetic website. I designed the website layouts with extreme thoughtfulness and a vision, while prioritizing functionality, visual appeal, clear implementation, security, and reliability. This project is just one example of how I approach my work: showcasing the uniqueness each brand has while attracting the right audience. 

This project bridges front-end development with my creative personal interest. The website is of a creative brand concept ahead of its time. Ela & Ela are two women with a versatile resume that do not need cookie-cutter marketing to find success in their skills, just the right website.

## Why It’s Here
This repo shows how I approach front-end development with a strong sense of **aesthetic design**, **creative branding**, and **component-based structure** using modern tools like React + Vite.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
