# Purpose
I built this website using React with JSX and Vite for a fast development environment. The modular components in React allow for each section (page) to be clearly separated and organized. Therefore, maintaining to each section became efficient. Within each section exists a .jsx and .css file, making it easy to manage styling and strucutre. I used Git/Github to manage version control.

This project is a 100% creative expression of my mind, bridging front-end development with my personal interests. I was eager to explore React development to create an editorial-style website. The content is inspired by a creative brand run by two women whose names both end in Ela—not Ella. 

The goal was to create a clean, intentional, and magnetic website. This project is just one example of how I approach my work: showcasing the uniqueness each brand offers while attracting the right audience. I design website layouts with extreme thoughtfulness and an open mind, while always prioritzing security, functionality, and clear implementation alongside visual appeal.

## Why It’s Here
This repo shows how I approach front-end development with a strong sense of **aesthetic design**, **creative branding**, and **component-based structure** using modern tools like React + Vite.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
